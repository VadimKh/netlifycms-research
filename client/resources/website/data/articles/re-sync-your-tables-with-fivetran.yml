  We know you sometimes need to overwrite an existing table to make sure you
  have everything you need — when, for example, an operation is performed on a
  source table that our incremental replication can’t detect (e.g., TRUNCATE).
  Until now, you could only fix the resulting data integrity issue by re-syncing
  an entire database. 


  That’s why we’re introducing Table Re-Sync, which gives you the ability to fix these issues at the table level whenever you see them. It’s a much simpler and more agile process.
   
  Table Re-Sync is available for the following connectors:


  * Salesforce

  * NetSuite

  * Marketo

  * MySQL

  * Oracle

  * Postgres

  * Zuora

  * SQL Server
   
  To use Table Re-Sync, just go to your connector details page and hover over the table you want to re-sync. Note that re-syncing a table will pause incremental updates until the historical data is loaded.

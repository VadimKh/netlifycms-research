  Trying to analyze data in CSV files can be repetitive work. Instead, save time
  by using
  [Fivetran](https://fivetran.com/?utm_campaign=fileupload_video&utm_medium=blog&utm_source=medium&utm_content=&utm_term=)
  to load your files into a data warehouse. With our file uploader, audit data
  types and set primary keys before you import and then save recipes for future
  uploads.


  Then, instead of performing vlookups manually, join your tables with the rest of your organization’s data within your warehouse. Craft your queries once and run them as often as new data is uploaded.

  In our efforts to give you more control over your data, Fivetran users can now
  block specific columns from replicating to your warehouse. The new feature
  enables you to avoid sending personally identifiable information (PII) to your
  data warehouse, bringing you into compliance with GDPR.


  Not only are we preventing the data from saving in your data warehouse, blocking is applied before it is persisted to temporary storage within Fivetran.

  Column Blocking is available for the following connectors:


  * Salesforce

  * NetSuite

  * Marketo

  * MySQL

  * Oracle

  * Postgres

  * Zuora

  * SQL Server


  You can use this feature by going to your connector details page and unchecking the columns you would like to omit from syncing.

  One of our early adopters, [Karel Kosterman](mailto:karel.kosterman@lightspeedhq.com), Team Lead, Development at [Lightspeed HQ](https://www.lightspeedhq.com/), says: “Just wanted to let you know that this feature is amazing! We have been struggling with this exact problem that is addressed here. This will simplify adding a new integration by a lot, and I can get rid of a good bunch of workarounds we had in place.”


  We hope you find it just as useful!

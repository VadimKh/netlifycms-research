  Fivetran should be your company’s default method of loading business data into
  a data warehouse. In addition to [supporting and replicating
  databases](https://fivetran.com/docs/databases), Fivetran syncs and
  [replicates data from dozens of business
  applications](https://fivetran.com/directory).


  We’re constantly updating these easy-to-set-up connectors and developing new ones. Today, we’re proud to announce the addition of the Fivetran connector for [Klaviyo](https://www.klaviyo.com/) — a leading ecommerce marketing platform.


  Klaviyo allows you to easily segment your audience and trigger targeted campaigns based on actual behavior instead of guesswork. You can target based on customers' real purchases, what they actually looked at on your website, where they actually interacted with your emails and how much they actually spent. That way, [you can send emails they actually want to receive](https://www.klaviyo.com/features/segmentation).


  >**"The Fivetran Klaviyo connector has helped us get a deeper understanding of our CRM outreach and how we re-target our repeat customer base."**


  Carlos Nido, an analyst for clothier [Chubbies](https://www.chubbiesshorts.com/) — a customer of Fivetran and Klaviyo — is quite satisfied with the Klaviyo connector. “We are very happy with the new Klaviyo connector," he says. "It has helped us get a deeper understanding of our CRM outreach and how we re-target our repeat customer base. Off the bat, we have been able to systematically quantify the effect of mixing in a fun lifestyle email to our customers in order to keep them interested in our brand."


  Here's a link to our [documentation](https://fivetran.com/docs/applications/klaviyo) for Klaviyo. Fivetran provides a complete [schema diagram](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ioSGR_4bro1YIDjZ_3Re-ieJp5vlPLBYMxc3DD0sRaA/edit#slide=id.g244d368397_0_1) too. As with all Fivetran connectors, the Klaviyo connector is super simple. You need an active Klaviyo account, and then, from the Fivetran user interface, just enter the desired destination schema name. Fivetran will assist you in getting an API key. Then you'll follow a few short final steps.

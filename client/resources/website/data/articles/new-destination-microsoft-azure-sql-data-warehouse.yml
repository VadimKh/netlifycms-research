  ## Microsoft Cloud Warehouse Steps Up Performance With Second-Generation Compute


  Boasting superior query performance, Azure SQL Data Warehouse Gen 2 has raised the bar. With increased performance on data warehouse benchmarks ([Gigaom Research](https://gigaom.com/report/data-warehouse-in-the-cloud-benchmark/#post-id-957223), 2018) and per-node data movement rates of up to [one-gigabyte per second](https://www.zdnet.com/article/microsoft-reveals-new-power-bi-and-azure-data-warehouse-capabilities/) per node (ZDNet, July 2018), Microsoft has continued to push boundaries with its cloud data warehouse technology.
   
  The Fivetran and Microsoft advantage: Fivetran makes it simple for business analysts and other non-engineers across your enterprise to use SQL—or any BI tool—to query Azure SQL Data Warehouse and [gain profound insight](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/sql-data-warehouse/) into the business. Fivetran automatically fetches and syncs data from more than [90 sources](https://fivetran.com/directory), including Marketo, MixPanel, Oracle on Amazon RDS, Azure Blob Storage, DoubleClick, LinkedIn Ads, Netsuite SuiteAnalytics, and Salesforce.

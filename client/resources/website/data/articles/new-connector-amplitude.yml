  The Fivetran Amplitude connector is now live in beta.
  [Amplitude](https://amplitude.com/) is a product analytics platform whose
  mission is to help businesses build and improve digital products. Amplitude
  can improve conversion rates and fuel growth by allowing companies to gain
  insights into how their users interact with their products.


  Our [documentation](https://fivetran.com/docs/applications/amplitude) explains how to set up this connector and includes an entity relationship diagram (ERD) of the schema.

  We’re proud to announce our 2018 Snowflake Partner of the Year Award!


  Snowflake chooses winners based on criteria that map to its [core values](https://www.snowflake.com/about/#our-values), and Fivetran won in the Get It Done category. That’s appropriate, given our mission: empowering analysts by making data centralization effortless. Snowflake and Fivetran recently advanced the cause with [Partner Connect](https://www.snowflake.com/news/snowflake-announces-partner-connect/), a pre-built Snowflake integration for Fivetran connectors that simplifies and accelerates the data loading process.


  ## Snowflake Partner Connect: Effortless Loading and Analysis


  If you’re using Snowflake and Fivetran, check out the “Partner Connect” tab in the Snowflake web interface. You’ll see a list of Snowflake’s data integration partners, including Fivetran. Use the “Connect” button to create a free Fivetran trial account — that’s it. Deploying a pipeline and warehouse for data analytics doesn’t get any easier. (Note that you’re creating new database, warehouse and user objects inside Snowflake for partner applications to interact with.)

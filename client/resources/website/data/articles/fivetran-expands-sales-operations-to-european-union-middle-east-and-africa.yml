  At Fivetran, our mission is to democratize data, make companies data-driven,
  and give analysts easy access to disparate data sources to perform advanced
  analytics.


  With that mission in mind, we’re continuing to release a slew of new product and feature offerings. We’re also broadening our sales-operations base to include the European Union (EU). We have just opened an office in Dublin, Ireland.


  Our Dublin address is Charlemont St, Saint Kevin’s, Dublin 2, Ireland. Fivetran is [compliant](https://blog.fivetran.com/fivetran-is-compliant-with-the-european-unions-gdpr-privacy-law-a3bd82dc120) with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) that takes force in the EU on May 25. Our Dublin office will be serving Europe, the Middle East and Africa.


  Fivetran is also hiring sales professionals at our Dublin office.


  And we have available sales and engineering positions at our offices in Denver, CO, Oakland, CA, and Bengaluru, India. Check the Fivetran [careers page](https://fivetran.com/careers) for details.


  Joining the Fivetran teams means you could work alongside our savvy and sophisticated staff whose recent accomplishments include the implementation of a [5-minute sync](https://blog.fivetran.com/fivetran-announces-5-minute-syncing-f61c788573a1) for all of our integrations with databases, business applications and file stores.


  We’ve also designed new integrations — what Fivetran calls “connectors.” The new connectors, all in beta, include [AdRoll](https://info.fivetran.com/acton/ct/32040/s-0043-1803/Bct/l-0da7/l-0da7:477/ct4_0/1?sid=TV2%3Ao80ajis0A), [DoubleClick Campaign Manager](https://info.fivetran.com/acton/ct/32040/s-0043-1803/Bct/l-0da7/l-0da7:477/ct5_0/1?sid=TV2%3Ao80ajis0A), [Email CSV ingestor](https://info.fivetran.com/acton/ct/32040/s-0043-1803/Bct/l-0da7/l-0da7:477/ct6_0/1?sid=TV2%3Ao80ajis0A), [Klaviyo](https://info.fivetran.com/acton/ct/32040/s-0043-1803/Bct/l-0da7/l-0da7:477/ct7_0/1?sid=TV2%3Ao80ajis0A), [LinkedIn Ad Analytics](https://info.fivetran.com/acton/ct/32040/s-0043-1803/Bct/l-0da7/l-0da7:477/ct8_0/1?sid=TV2%3Ao80ajis0A), [Optimizely](https://info.fivetran.com/acton/ct/32040/s-0043-1803/Bct/l-0da7/l-0da7:477/ct9_0/1?sid=TV2%3Ao80ajis0A), [SendGrid](https://info.fivetran.com/acton/ct/32040/s-0043-1803/Bct/l-0da7/l-0da7:477/ct10_0/1?sid=TV2%3Ao80ajis0A), [Yahoo Gemini](https://info.fivetran.com/acton/ct/32040/s-0043-1803/Bct/l-0da7/l-0da7:477/ct11_0/1?sid=TV2%3Ao80ajis0A) and [others](https://info.fivetran.com/acton/ct/32040/s-0043-1803/Bct/l-0da7/l-0da7:5be/ct1_0/1?sid=TV2%3AaGGnPZyI9).

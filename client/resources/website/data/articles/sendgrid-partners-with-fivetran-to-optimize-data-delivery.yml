  Founded in 2009, [SendGrid](https://sendgrid.com/) is a leading digital
  communications platform, enabling businesses to engage with their customers
  via email reliably, effectively and at scale.
  [Fivetran](https://fivetran.com/) builds data pipelines connecting and
  replicating disparate business data sources to a data warehouse — for the goal
  of advanced analytics on a grand and granular scale. With Fivetran, SendGrid
  users can co-mingle data from their SendGrid accounts with data from their
  other business applications to gain deep insights into all of that data.


  “It was only a matter of time until Fivetran and SendGrid would become partners. SendGrid’s platform already provides engagement data in real time. With Fivetran, our customers can get even wider views into their own companies and customers,” says Elliot Goldwater, director of business development at SendGrid.


  Logan Welley, who heads the Fivetran partnership program, agreed. “Adding SendGrid to the growing list of Fivetran technology partners was bound to happen. Each company enhances the other company, all of which benefits end users and their goal of performing agile analytics,” Welley says.


  SendGrid is just one of the [dozens of connectors](https://fivetran.com/directory) Fivetran offers. These connectors are the data from your business applications, and databases, that Fivetran syncs into a data warehouse for you.

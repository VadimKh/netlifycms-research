  Our engineering team gathered from their usual offices in Oakland, Bengaluru, and Kaluga to spend the week of January 13, 2019, at a retreat in Phuket, Thailand. Our team members trickled in over the course of Sunday night, which concluded with a cocktail hour:

  On Monday, we had Geek Club instructionals. Topics included machine learning, bash scripting, UI, and public APIs:

  We spent about six hours on Tuesday on a training video Makeathon. Using the scenic backdrop of the island for inspiration, we covered more than ten topics. If you’d like to see the videos, [we are hiring](https://fivetran.com/careers)!


  A 24-hour Hackathon ran from Tuesday to Wednesday, in which the engineers divided into six teams to prototype new products for Fivetran:

  On Wednesday, we had a fireside chat discussing the history of the engineering team.


  And, of course, everyone relaxed and explored the island all throughout their stay, too:

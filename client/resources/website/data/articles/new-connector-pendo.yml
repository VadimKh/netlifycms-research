  Fivetran has released a Pendo connector in beta.
  [Pendo](https://www.pendo.io/) helps businesses create better product
  experiences for customers. Businesses can capture data on user interaction
  with their products without having to write any code. They can also deliver
  personalized guidance to users and receive helpful user feedback.


  Our [documentation](https://fivetran.com/docs/applications/pendo) explains how to set up this connector and includes an entity relationship diagram (ERD) of the schema.

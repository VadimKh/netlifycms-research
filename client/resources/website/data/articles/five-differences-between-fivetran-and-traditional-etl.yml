  Classic data integration tools force analysts to predict what insights they
  can glean from a limited data set and then build a resource-intensive workflow
  around it that is dated and inflexible. Fivetran changes everything with a
  fully automated data pipeline built especially for analysts. With automation
  extracting and loading the disparate data directly into your data warehouse,
  Fivetran provides a faster, better way to centralize all of your data sources
  so you can quickly model and obtain meaningful insights using your favorite BI
  Tools.

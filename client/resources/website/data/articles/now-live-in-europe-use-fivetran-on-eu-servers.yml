  We are excited to announce that Fivetran connectors can now be used on EU
  region servers. We know how important this is for your [compliance with
  GDPR](https://fivetran.com/blog/fivetran-is-compliant-with-the-european-unions-gdpr-privacy-law)
  and we are here to help. You can learn more about it in our
  [documentation](https://fivetran.com/docs/getting-started/core-concepts#fivetranservers).


  To migrate your Fivetran service to the EU, follow the below steps:


  1. **Whitelist our IP addresses in your source system or warehouse for select vendors.** All Fivetran connectors will now originate from a new set of fixed IP addresses. For the European region, these IPs are 35.235.32.144/29, 35.205.2.0/29 and 52.0.2.4/32. To use Fivetran on EU servers, you must update your IP whitelists for the following data sources and warehouses:

      - AWS Redshift
      - Azure SQL Data Warehouse
      - MariaDB
      - MongoDB
      - MySQL
      - Oracle
      - PostgreSQL
      - Snowflake
      - SQL Server

  2. **In Fivetran, change the Region in the Warehouse tab from your dashboard.**

  Once you complete Step 2, connectors will automatically start running on Fivetran servers in the EU region.

  If you're like Fivetran, you're in a constant state of hiring. To allieviate
  hiring headaches, companies like Airbnb, DocuSign, Evernote, the Golden State
  Warriors, Lyft, Pinterest and a host of others choose
  [Greenhouse](https://fivetran.com/directory/greenhouse?utm_source=fivetran&utm_medium=blog&utm_campaign=greenhouse_partnership&utm_content=directory_greenhouse)
  as their solution. Greenhouse is an applicant-tracking and recruiting software
  tool designed to optimize the entire recruiting process.


  The recruitment firm enables 2,700 companies to process and onboard millions of people. That's a lot of data. 


  [Fivetran](https://fivetran.com/?utm_source=fivetran&utm_medium=blog&utm_campaign=greenhouse_partnership&utm_content=home) can help make sense of it all. With Fivetran, Greenhouse customers can meld their Greenhouse data with data from their other business applications to gain deep insights.


  Our [dozens of data connectors](https://fivetran.com/directory?utm_source=fivetran&utm_medium=blog&utm_campaign=greenhouse_partnership&utm_content=directory), including one for Greenhouse, replicate data into your warehouse, ensure it's up to date and accessible, and promote agile workflows that require less planning and fewer resources. Setup takes just minutes, and our pre-engineered connectors adjust to schema changes automatically, so you can focus on unlocking insights.


  "With the Fivetran Greenhouse connector now integrated with our data warehouse, we can provide our recruiting team with a dynamic business intelligence solution to tracking ClassPass Recruitment Metrics, which was previously done through a very manual reporting process," explains Wilson Chu, Senior Manager of BI at ClassPass, a mutual customer of Fivetran and Greenhouse.


  Fivetran is pleased to announce that not only is Greenhouse among the latest additions to our ever-growing menu of offered data connectors, but it's also one of our newest [business partners](https://fivetran.com/partners?utm_source=fivetran&utm_medium=blog&utm_campaign=greenhouse_partnership&utm_content=partners).


  "The Fivetran and Greenhouse partnership shows that data can and should be analyzed beyond the bread-and-butter solution of gaining deep insights into your company and customers," says Logan Welley, who heads the Fivetran partnership program. "Data can help you hire the right, and not the wrong, employees to help businesses attract meaningful talent and grow."


  Garret Starr, Director of Partnerships at Greenhouse, agrees. 


  "Greenhouse understands the increasing importance of data in talent acquisition and enables its clients to make data-driven recruiting decisions," he says. "Because of this, we're excited to partner with Fivetran, which leverages our powerful APIs to give joint users additional opportunities to evaluate their recruiting data alongside reports from the rest of the HR function."

  At Fivetran, we're supporting and building a culture of agile analytics as we
  advance our cloud-powered, data-rich technology to help analysts replicate
  data into a cloud warehouse.


  We're continuing to build business partnerships, and we're developing dozens of [connectors](https://fivetran.com/directory?utm_source=fivetran&utm_medium=blog&utm_campaign=uservoice_partnership&utm_content=directory) that, after a five-minute setup, replicate your applications, databases, events and files into a high-performance data warehouse. Our standardized cloud pipelines are fully managed and zero-maintenance.


  One of our newest connectors is [UserVoice](https://fivetran.com/directory/uservoice?utm_source=fivetran&utm_medium=blog&utm_campaign=uservoice_partnership&utm_content=directory_uservoice), an industry leader in collecting user feedback and making that feedback actionable for product management teams. 


  [UserVoice](https://www.uservoice.com/product/) describes itself as a solution that "wrangles feedback from multiple sources and teams into a single source of truth" and as a platform to "let your customers know they're being heard." The tool takes some of the guesswork out of product development.


  [Fivetran](https://fivetran.com/?utm_source=fivetran&utm_medium=blog&utm_campaign=uservoice_partnership&utm_content=home) allows UserVoice customers to combine UserVoice data with data from all their other applications. In the end, this enables companies to gain deep insights into their business and their customers' behavior.


  In addition to welcoming UserVoice as one of the latest additions to the ever-expanding roster of Fivetran connectors, we're also excited to announce that UserVoice is among our newest business partners as well.


  "UserVoice and Fivetran are partnering because we’re both part of a growing cloud ecosystem not requiring heavy engineering," says Logan Welley, who heads the Fivetran partnership program. "Businesses are awash in data and Fivetran and UserVoice offer ways to help make sense of it all."


  According to UserVoice CEO Richard White, "Both UserVoice and Fivetran strongly believe in data to take your business to the next level. Data should inform all aspects of your business. It helps remove the emotion from difficult decisions, especially about the products you're making."
